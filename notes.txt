!! Store login username/password in each GptKlass child,
     and add config setup to allow offer-filling from multiple GPT Sites in one run of the application.
     It will basically just load one GPT Site, go through all the appropriate offers, and then go on to the next GPT Site and do the same thing without me having to do anything!

!! Add debug div in case window.onkeypress gets overwritten
   ex. http://100mcdonalds.giftcertificatedelivery.com/form/iframe/22428/6538/?&sid=400148&ref=22428

!! If no labelEl for a form input, check the placeholder attribute or the value of the input itself... Sometimes the info I'm looking for will be set as a value inside the input itself.

!! Forms inside iframes!  Sometimes the form / submit button is inside an iframe! Open in new window and fill out there?

!! If there's any recaptcha (https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/js/recaptcha.js or derivative script), just forget it and skip offer

!! Parse the offer description on the GPT site for the word 'click'.  This indicates that there should be no form to fill out, and I should click around based on button square pixelage (???)

!! For selects, the proper value sometimes seems to be the default 0 index value itself (very common with birthdays where each one says day, month, year, etc.)
   If a select, look there first!

?! What about fields that are used as placeholders?? When clicked, they show the proper field, which is invisible on page load and will never get parsed!!

?? Some date inputs pop up and have a javascript calendar-type widget... how to handle that?

?? How to pass e.which to jQuery's triggers?

?? What about human verification questions (i.e. 'Enter "2" in this box' type questions)

!? Keep track of form info names already filled out!  It's unlikely you'll have to enter it twice in any offer, so store them so they won't be filled out more than once, even across multiple pages!
   EDIT: Probably very likely you'll enter it twice every offer.

!? A lot of redirects take you to offers that DEFINITELY have NO relationship with what is described on the GPT Site.... down the road maybe check document.title for similarity against the offer?

?? Maybe don't submit if offer is "not available at this time"... will it be available later?

!? Some form inputs don't have names, like the selects in https://www.kelloggsfamilyrewards.com/en_US/promotions/coupons/login.html?referring_source=kfracquisition2013_permissiondata_display_cpa_ron&utm_source=permissiondata&utm_medium=display&utm_content=cpa_ron_codesave5_160x600&utm_campaign=kfracquisition2013

<> Fill out random checkbox values, not every single one!

<> Fill out random radio value, not always the first one!

<> If a radio button has already been filled out of a list of radio buttons that share the same name, decrease the setTimeout milliseconds or skip them entirely somehow.

<> Multiple textbox fields!!  Are phone and social security the only ones????? Probably make code reusable with other form info names just in case!

<> Need to inject a script into the content window for checking checkboxes (ones that NEED to be checked, like 'Terms' or 'Privacy').
   Apparently doing it from the extension doesn't trigger the right things.
   ex. https://www.getyourautoloan.com/FederalAutoButton/ApplyStepTwo.aspx
   <> it was a bug that triggered clicks on onclick inputs (like the 'terms' checkbox, thereby unchecking it before submitting it)

<? What if there's more than 4 forms on the page??
     ex. points2shop.com
     EDIT: I guess this is being solved now with the width/height calculations - DM - 011213

<> Need to inject a script into the content window to submit the form for it to work properly!

<> Multiple phone text fields

<> Some form inputs have really fucked up names.  For example, email input fields sometimes have completely irrelevant names, like 'from'... ?!?!?
     Use the labelEl to find the right form info type if the value remains an empty string after parsing the name!
     ex. http://rashkinonlineleaders.com/?site=myownAaronSophiaMLMRD?t=RD-4688-592

<> Time to store all forms completed thoughout the course of a single offer.

<> Sort forms by largest form first (by square footage)...
     Same with clicking on submits and input els in attempt to submit!

<> On change event is NOT fired when value is directly changed using jQuery's val method
<> Blur and focus events are fired when using jQuery's blur/focus, respectively
<> Value captured in keydown is the old value prior to key press, while value captured in keyup is the new value after key press

## With input type="image":
     -- onclick is triggered but NOT onsubmit when clicked manually
     -- x and y are included in the POST only when clicked manually
     -- if you add x and y hidden inputs to the form and click the input type="image" manually, they will be overwritten!

## For forms inside iframes:
     -- the url of the iframe is always the same, no matter how many times you refresh, so you can go straight to the source and parse it inside there
