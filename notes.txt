!! Store login username/password in each GptKlass child,
     and add config setup to allow offer-filling from multiple GPT Sites in one run of the application.
     It will basically just load one GPT Site, go through all the appropriate offers, and then go on to the next GPT Site and do the same thing without me having to do anything!

!! Need to inject a script into the content window to submit the form for it to work properly!

!! If no labelEl for a form input, check the placeholder attribute or the value of the input itself... Sometimes the info I'm looking for will be set as a value inside the input itself.

?! What about forms inside iframes?  Sometimes the submit button is inside an iframe, and when it gets manually clicked it tells the parent window to redirect.
     They have to be the same origin, so is it possible to query the child from the parent and find the rest of the form that way?

?? How to pass e.which to jQuery's triggers?

?? What about human verification questions (i.e. 'Enter "2" in this box' type questions)


<? What if there's more than 4 forms on the page??
     ex. points2shop.com
     EDIT: I guess this is being solved now with the width/height calculations - DM - 011213


<> Multiple phone text fields

<> Some form inputs have really fucked up names.  For example, email input fields sometimes have completely irrelevant names, like 'from'... ?!?!?
     Use the labelEl to find the right form info type if the value remains an empty string after parsing the name!
     ex. http://rashkinonlineleaders.com/?site=myownAaronSophiaMLMRD?t=RD-4688-592

<> Time to store all forms completed thoughout the course of a single offer.

<> Sort forms by largest form first (by square footage)...
     Same with clicking on submits and input els in attempt to submit!

<> On change event is NOT fired when value is directly changed using jQuery's val method
<> Blur and focus events are fired when using jQuery's blur/focus, respectively
<> Value captured in keydown is the old value prior to key press, while value captured in keyup is the new value after key press

## With input type="image":
     -- onclick is triggered but NOT onsubmit when clicked manually
     -- x and y are included in the POST only when clicked manually
     -- if you add x and y hidden inputs to the form and click the input type="image" manually, they will be overwritten!
