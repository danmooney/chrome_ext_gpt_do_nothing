What if there's more than 4 forms on the page??
ex. points2shop.com
Time to store all forms completed thoughout the course of a single offer.

Maybe sort forms by largest form first?

## With input type="image":
-- onclick is triggered but NOT onsubmit when clicked manually
-- x and y are included in the POST only when clicked manually
-- if you add x and y hidden inputs to the form and click the input type="image" manually, they will be overwritten!
