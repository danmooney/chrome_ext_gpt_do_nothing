??  What if there's more than 4 forms on the page??
    ex. points2shop.com

??  How to pass e.which to jQuery's triggers?

<> Time to store all forms completed thoughout the course of a single offer.

!! Sort forms by largest form first (by square footage)...
      Same with clicking on submits and input els in attempt to submit!

<> On change event is NOT fired when value is directly changed using jQuery's val method
<> Blur and focus events are fired when using jQuery's blur/focus, respectively
<> Value captured in keydown is the old value prior to key press, while value captured in keyup is the new value after key press

## With input type="image":
-- onclick is triggered but NOT onsubmit when clicked manually
-- x and y are included in the POST only when clicked manually
-- if you add x and y hidden inputs to the form and click the input type="image" manually, they will be overwritten!
