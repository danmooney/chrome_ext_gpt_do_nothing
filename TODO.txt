##### FOR BYPASSING WINDOW.ALERT #####
overwrite window.alert to another function

This actually works!  Use it to capture the string to determine what it's trying to tell you without actually alerting!

window.oldalert = window.alert
window.alert = function (str) {console.warn('working: ' + str); oldalert(str);};


##### FOR DETERMINING STARTING URL #####
Fetch all Urls on init in Url class by going through every Gpt child and getting starting Urls there.
In other words, remove starting url logic from Url itself and put inside GPT child klass!
